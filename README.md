# gdp-analysis-of-india-using-python

 
## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a data analysis project focused on **GDP trends**.  
The goal is to explore, analyze, and visualize GDP data to extract meaningful insights and present them in a clear, data-driven way.

## ✨ Key Features
- Load and process GDP data using **pandas**
- Generate summary statistics for better understanding of the dataset
- Create visualizations with **matplotlib** for trend analysis
- Handle large datasets efficiently with custom display settings

## 📂 Repository Structure
```
├── Untitled28.ipynb   # Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis
├── SGDP.csv           # GDP dataset (not included in repo)
└── README.md          # Project documentation
```

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3**
- **pandas** – data manipulation and analysis
- **numpy** – numerical computations
- **matplotlib** – data visualization

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:
